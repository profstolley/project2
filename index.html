      <p>
        I am an electrical designer with experiance in a variety of electrical applications from
        commercial to utility/industrial. I also have some engineering experiance and am gearing my
        career more towards the engineering aspect of electrical design in power generation and
        distribution. I am looking to stay with in the utility and/or commercial industries and
        utilize my combined design/engineering experiences to explore new opportunites.
      </p>
      <p>
        In line with my goal of transitioning towards more engineering in my career I've been
        pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on power systems and distribution.
        This type of focus falls in line with the experience I already have and the direction I want
        to go.

    <h2 id="work">Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
      My work experience includes layouts of lighing, power, conduit, grounding, equipment and fire detection/notification systems. I utilize the NEC, NFPA, Life Safety Code, and numerous other building codes as well as company and client standards in creating the designs for the required systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I've done power alanlysis, fault current calculations, and lighitng level calculations. These are done in order to determine designs meet requirements and/or to determine what may be needed in order to complete a proper design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are a couple of snapshots of portions of lighting designs I've worked on, one at a plant and one at a casino.

      I enjoy cross-stitch, crotcheting, and knitting as relaxing activities during those rare moments I have to sit and relax. I like to find patterns or have patterns made from phots. The Detroit Lions blanket I made for my brother-in-law is an example of one of the crotchet blankets I've made.

      Additionally, I love to read who-done-it type crime and mystery novels. One of my favorite authors is Patricia Cornwell. Her Kay Scarpetta series has had me intrigued for over 20 years. I also very much enjoy the Kinsey Millhone series by Sue Grafton. Sadly, Ms. Grafton is now deceased prior to publizing the Z title of the series (this is an alphabet based series starting with "A is for Aliby"). I've yet to complete either series but am in progress. Other authors I favor are Robin Cook, James Patterson, Tess Gerrisen, and Stephen King. I also have a whole slew of books waiting in my nook library from authors I want to start reading if I ever get enough time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exercise is also something I enjoy. Jogging on my treadmill and using my bowflex help me to not just keep in shape but relieve stress. Sadly, I don't get to do much of this when I'm both working full time and taking classes. Work and school take up much of my time, and then I have family and theocratic responsibilities as well.
